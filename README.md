## About Website #1
##### 1. Description
This static website is based of lakshyaca.com. Coded in around 1hr , around 80% of the look was acheived except for the "Download Brochure" section. 

For the "Download Brochure" section, multiple options were tested but the same look was not acheieved. It was also felt that, a long list of items was not ideal UI-wise, an thus Bootstraps "Dynamic Navigation Menu" was used instead.

As this is a static website, menus/forms/downloads do not work. They will be worked on once sufficient expertise in JavaScript is gained.
